# Apps — Terms of Use

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the following guidelines. They are designed to ensure a beneficial experience for us both.

## General

By using my apps, you agree to these terms and any subsequent changes. I may update them without direct notice. Always check the latest terms here.

## Permitted Use

You may use my apps without restrictions for their intended purposes. However, malicious usage is strictly prohibited.

## App Store

If you get my apps from the App Store, [Apple’s EULA](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/) applies.

## Software Integrity

Perfection is the goal, but occasional bugs may appear. I deeply value the trust you place in my apps, yet I cannot promise complete flawlessness. For your peace of mind, regular backups are highly recommended.

## Liability

I disclaim all liability arising from the use or misuse of my apps. Users assume all risks and consequences tied to their actions based on the apps' functionality or content.

## Refunds

For apps purchased on the Apple App Store, you can [request a refund](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084). However, I would appreciate if you [reached out](/feedback) first. I may be able to resolve any problems you are having.

## Support

I aim to address all support and related queries within a week. There might be occasional delays, and I appreciate your understanding.
