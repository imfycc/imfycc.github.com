# About imfycc

I currently work full time as a nodejs full-stack developer and in my spare time I develop applications for the Apple ecosystem in Swift. I am working towards becoming an independent developer to gain financial, time, and work freedom. Thank you for using the applications that I have developed and I hope they help you in your life.
