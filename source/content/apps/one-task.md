Show a single task on your Home Screen, Lock Screen, or desktop.

Add some tasks to the app and then add the widget. Simply tap the widget to mark the task as completed. The next task will then appear.

The simplicity is a feature. The app will not have things like folders, tags, priority, notes, etc.

The optimal workflow in One Task is to add only the tasks you're committed to completing today. The app is designed for task completion, not endless organization and neglect.

It syncs tasks over iCloud. Note that the macOS version has an issue where it doesn't sync while being the active window (macOS bug).

### Tips

#### Import tasks from other todo apps

You can quickly import tasks from other todo apps by copying the tasks from such apps into One Task with the “Tasks: Paste” button.

For example, on macOS, select the tasks you want in Reminders or Things, right-click and copy them, and then paste them into One Task using the “Tasks: Paste” button.

#### How is this different from your [One Thing](/one-thing) app?

One Thing lets you put a single piece of text in the menu bar. This app is focused on tasks, and allows you to queue multiple tasks, and check them off upon completion. This app is also available on iOS and uses widgets instead of the menu bar.

#### iCloud syncing does not work

Troubleshooting:
- Ensure you are on the latest version of the app and iOS/macOS.
- Ensure the devices are signed into the same iCloud account.
- Ensure the devices are online.
- Ensure Low Power Mode is not enabled on the devices. It can cause iCloud to delay syncing.
- Try restarting the devices.
- If you are using a VPN, try disconnecting it. Some VPNs prevent iCloud from syncing.

Known issue:
- Because of a macOS bug, the macOS app does not sync with iCloud while it's focused.

#### Does the app integrate with other todo apps?

No, One Task deliberately avoids automatic integration with other todo apps. Most todo apps encourage task hoarding, leading to overwhelm and inaction. One Task focuses on actionable items you commit to completing within the day. Manually select your highest-priority tasks and add them to One Task for focused execution.

#### Does the app support recurring tasks? {#recurring-tasks}

No. I want to keep this app super simple.

However, you can achieve this using the Shortcuts app. Create a [shortcut](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) that uses the “Add Task” action to add the tasks you want to be recurring. Then create an [automation](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/apdfbdbd7123/7.0/ios/17.0) to run the shortcut at a certain interval. For example, every morning.

*(macOS does not yet have automations. You can use [Shortery](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1594183810) for now.)*

#### Does the app support task templates? {#task-templates}

No, but you can achieve this using the Shortcuts app. Modify [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51edae78b820457a89d12715a053fac6) and run it every time you want to apply the template tasks. You could even add the shortcut to the Home Screen.

#### Why doesn't the app have folders, tags, or priorities?

One Task is designed for action, not endless categorization. It omits features like folders, tags, and priorities to eliminate distractions and decision fatigue. The app's core functionality is to help you commit to and complete tasks today.

#### Can you add a widget setting to choose background color?

I don't plan to add this. I want to keep the app super simple.

#### The text in the widget is quite large

The text automatically scales down to fit more content.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6465745322) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't plan to localize the app.

### Non-App Store Version

A special version for users that cannot access the App Store. It won't receive automatic updates. I will update it here once a year.
