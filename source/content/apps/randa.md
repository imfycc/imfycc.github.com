Randa lets you easily generate a random number. Just set a minimum and maximum number and you will get a random number in that range.

This can be useful for decision-making, picking stuff from a list, board games, dice rolling, coin flips, etc. For example, it's Netflix & chill night and you cannot decide on a movie. Just generate a random number from 1 to 20 and pick the movie at that position in your watchlist. Need to make a yes or no decision (coin flip)? Just set the minimum to 0 and the maximum to 1.
